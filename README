Network Simulator
=================

This is an assignment for Level-3/Term-2.

Overview
--------

A wireless network simulator is built with ns2 and parsed with awk.

The parameters for the network are as follows:

- Wireless MAC Type
    [ ] Wireless 802.15.4
    [x] Wireless 802.11
- Routing Protocol
    [x] DSDV
    [ ] AODV
    [ ] DSR
- Agent + Application
    [ ] UDP + Exponential Traffic
    [ ] UDP + CBR Traffic
    [ ] TCP Reno + FTP
    [x] TCP Tahoe + Telnet,
- Node Positioning
    [x] Random (Randomly place nodes anywhere with area)
    [ ] Grid (Place nodes in a grid. You can choose the number of rows and
        columns yourself)
- Flow
    [ ] Random Source Destination (For each flow, choose random source and
        destination. Careful not to choose same node as source and destination)
    [x] 1 Source, Random Sink (except source itself) (Choose a random source X,
        then for each flow choose X as source, and any other node as
        destination)
    [ ] 1 Sink, Random Source (Choose a random sink X, then for each flow choose
        X as destination, and any other node as source)
- Queue: Droptail, max size 50 (Using Queue/DropTail/PriQueue with DSR may cause
  segmentation fault. In that case you can use CMUPriQueue instead.)
- Antenna: Omni Directional
- Speed of nodes: Uniform random between 1m/s and 5m/s for each node.
- Propagation Model: Two Ray Ground Propagation Model


The simulation is to be run a number of times with varying parameters and the
results are to be plotted on graph.

Baseline Parameters
(while varying one parameter, keep other parameters fixed like below)
    - Area Size: 500m x 500m
    - Number of Nodes: 40
    - Number of flows: 20

Vary parameters
    - Area Size
        - 250m x 250m
        - 500m x 500m
        - 750m x 750m
        - 1000m x 1000m
        - 1250m x 1250m
    - Number of Nodes
        - 20
        - 40
        - 60
        - 80
        - 100
    - Number of flows
        - 10
        - 20
        - 30
        - 40
        - 50

Metrics: For each of the varying parameters, plot 4 graph showing,
    - Network throughput
    - End-to-end delay
    - Packet delivery ratio (total # of packets delivered to end destination /
      total # of packets sent)
    - Packet drop ratio (total # of packets dropped / total # of packets sent)
